# Privacy Policy for Buddhist Reflection

_Last updated: September 10, 2025_

## Overview

Buddhist Reflection ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Reflections

* Meditation reflections and thoughts you choose to record
* Stone selections (white/black) and categories you assign
* Timestamps of your meditation sessions

### Facial Data Collection

* **TrueDepth Camera Data**: Our app uses the TrueDepth camera (on supported devices like iPhone X and later) to detect mouth movements for the Mantra Counter feature
* **Facial Landmark Data**: We collect real-time 3D facial mesh data and blend shape coefficients specifically for mouth movement detection
* **Purpose**: This data is used exclusively for counting Buddhist mantra repetitions by detecting jaw opening, lip rounding, and mouth puckering movements
* **Processing**: All facial data is processed entirely on your device in real-time and is not stored or transmitted to any servers
* **Retention**: Facial data is discarded immediately after processing and is not retained

### Technical Information

* Device push notification tokens (for sending meditation reminders)
* Basic app usage analytics
* Crash reports to improve app stability

## How We Use Your Information

* To provide personalized meditation reminders
* To track your mindfulness progress through stone analytics
* To enable hands-free mantra counting through facial movement detection
* To improve app functionality and user experience
* To send you gentle Buddhist reflection prompts

## Data Storage and Security

* Your data is stored securely using Firebase/Google Cloud services
* All reflections and personal data are encrypted in transit and at rest
* **Facial data is processed entirely on-device and is never stored or transmitted**
* We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information
* Your meditation data is private and not shared with third parties

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal meditation data with third parties. Your reflections, stone selections, and facial data remain private to you. Facial data collected through the TrueDepth API is processed locally on your device and is never shared with any external parties.

## Push Notifications

We use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send you meditation reminders. You can disable these notifications at any time through your device settings.

## Data Retention

* Your meditation data is retained as long as you use the app
* **Facial data is not retained** - it is processed in real-time and discarded immediately
* You may request deletion of your data by contacting us

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

* Access your personal data
* Correct inaccurate data
* Request deletion of your data
* Disable push notifications
* Disable facial recognition features (the app will fall back to manual counting)

## Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
